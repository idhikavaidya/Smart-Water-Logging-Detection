ðŸŒŠ **Smart Waterlogging Detection**

This project integrates Machine Learning, Power BI, and Spatial Analysis using ArcGIS to identify areas prone to waterlogging. The dataset includes key environmental factors such as slope, drainage, soil texture, flow accumulation, terrain indices (TRI, TWI, TPI), vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, NDMI), land cover, and population density.

Project Highlights

âœ… Developed and trained a machine learning model using environmental factors to classify waterlogging-prone areas.

âœ… Performed spatial analysis in ArcGIS to enhance geospatial insights.

âœ… Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters and KPIs for detailed insights.

âœ… Enhanced decision-making with data-driven predictions and visual analytics.

This project enables better flood risk management and urban planning by combining predictive analytics with spatial intelligence.
