ðŸŒŠ **Waterlogging Identification: ML & Power BI**  

The dataset contains key environmental factors like slope, drainage, soil texture, flow accumulation, terrain indices (TRI, TWI, TPI), vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, NDMI), land cover, and population density. The dataset was used to train the model , the model is able to classify wether a particular record has a water logging risk. The PowerBI dashboard has interactive visuals and filters of the KPI which enables the user to get detailed insights of the
